                <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims,
                    such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the
                    development of understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role
                    of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some theorists require that
                    education results in an improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the
                    term. In a slightly different sense, education may also refer, not to the process, but to the product of
                    this process: the mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people. Education originated as
                    the transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals
                    increasingly encompass new ideas such as the liberation of learners, skills needed for modern society,
                    empathy, and complex vocational skills. </p>

                    <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">Types of education are commonly divided into formal, non-formal, and
                        informal education. Formal education takes place in education and training institutions, is usually
                        structured by curricular aims and objectives, and learning is typically guided by a teacher. In most
                        regions, formal education is compulsory up to a certain age and commonly divided into educational stages
                        such as kindergarten, primary school and secondary school. Nonformal education occurs as addition or
                        alternative to formal education.[1] It may be structured according to educational arrangements, but in a
                        more flexible manner, and usually takes place in community-based, workplace-based or civil society-based
                        settings. Lastly, informal education occurs in daily life, in the family, any experience that has a
                        formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational, whether
                        unintentional or intentional. In practice there is a continuum from the highly formalized to the highly
                        informalized, and informal learning can occur in all three settings.[2] For instance, homeschooling can
                        be classified as nonformal or informal, depending upon the structure.</p>

                        <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">Education is commonly subdivided into different types. The most common
                            subdivision is between formal, non-formal, and informal education.[35][36][7][37] However, some
                            theorists only distinguish between formal and informal education.[38] A process of teaching constitutes
                            formal education if it happens in a complex institutionalized framework. Such frameworks are usually
                            chronologically and hierarchically organized as in modern schooling systems, which have different
                            classes based on the student's age and progress, all the way from primary school to university. Because
                            of its scale, formal education is usually controlled and guided by a governmental entity and is normally
                            compulsory up to a certain age.[35][39] Non-formal and informal education differ from formal education
                            due to their lack of such a governmental institutionalized framework. Non-formal education constitutes a
                            middle ground in the sense that it is also organized, systematic, and carried out with a clear purpose
                            in mind, such as tutoring, fitness classes, or the scouting movement. </p>
